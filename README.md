EatEase Project Summary

The EatEase project is a task management system for bars and restaurants that allows for employee management, task distribution, inventory tracking, and cleaning tools management in a sophisticated and object-oriented manner (OOP). The system is built with hierarchical classes, management through polymorphism, a collection of objects, event-driven programming, graphical representation, and the ability to save and restore the current state of the system.

Main Features
1. Employee Management: The system can add a new employee to its database, define their permissions and roles.
2. Team Task Distribution: The system allocates teams to tasks based on their roles and responsibilities.
3. Task Definition: Tasks can be defined with start times, end times, due dates, responsible persons, and performers.
4. Inventory Tracking: The system tracks the current and desired quantities of inventory, displaying the required amount to maintain full stock.
5. Cleaning Tools Management: The system includes a database of cleaning tools and tracks what needs to be cleaned.
6. State Saving and Restoration: The system supports saving and restoring the current state of the object system through serialization.


System Requirements and Implementation
1. Hierarchical Class System
The system includes multiple hierarchical classes, including a base class (Base) which is not from C# or any given package. For example:

Base
Person
Employee
Manager
Staff
Task
InventoryItem
CleaningTool
2. Management via Polymorphism
The management of classes is done via polymorphism, allowing flexible use of base and derived classes.

3. Object Organization via Collections
Objects are organized using collections such as List, Dictionary, etc.

4. Adding, Modifying, and Deleting Objects
The system includes functions for adding, modifying, and deleting objects.

5. Event-Driven Programming
The system supports event-driven programming, allowing users to perform various actions through events.

6. Graphical Representation of Objects
The system includes a graphical representation of objects, for example, through a graphical user interface (GUI).

7. Saving and Restoring the Current State of the Object System
The system supports saving and restoring the current state of the object system through serialization.
